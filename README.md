Well, I got the code to do what it needed to. Loops aren't working right, and kept trying to re-title my index.html file to "medford" for some bizzare reason. Decided on the brute force method.

Bug fixes include:
1.0 - Created basic functionality using brute force coding with known methodology.
1.1 - De-buggered the decimal points cluttering my beautiful numbers. Error occured because the "this.donutsThisHour" function lacked a math.floor() cleanup. Perhaps the first quick fix of the project so far.


To-do:
--------------
0. Figure out how to set table lines using loops and DOM mods
1. Get arrays set with useful values
2. figure out how to pull from those arrays using loops
3. find donuts and either eat them or set them ablaze. [optional]
