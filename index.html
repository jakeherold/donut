  <h1>Brute Force Donuts</h1>
  <p>This particular section of code is not pretty. It is not efficient. It is not something that should be emulated or really even looked upon by anyone who wants to see code that is clever or well constructed.

  However. What this JavaScript lacks in beauty, it makes up for in function. What we have here is a beautiful 14x5 table that spits out lots of info on donuts. There'll be a series of recursive loop-the-loops and some arrays tomorrow. However, for the time being, I found a workaround in order to complete the donut-information goal. </p>
